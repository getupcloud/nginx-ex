# Nginx example

This repo is an example on how to serve static content using Nginx on OpenShift.

Drop your static files in the root of the repo so it will be visible to nginx.

You can customize server config by creating the directory `nginx-cfg/` and placing your `.conf` files there.

Please note your config must listen to port 8080
